In "Ships Game" 2 players compete to destroy oponent's ships. Every ship is armed with rockets, which are used to attack other ships.

2. **Ships**:
In game there are 4 types of ships with different values of health points, size, movement and they carry different rockets. All ships are on the board in a horizontal position, meaning all squares have the same Y coordinate.
If ship has multiple sqaures, they must be connected as if they formed a rectangle. Ships have also names, described as one chracter. It is recommended to use different capital letters to name firt player's ships and to use
different small letters to name second player's ships. The ship is displayed on the baord by putting it's name letter on every field, which is occupied by this ship.
